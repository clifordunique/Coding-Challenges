# Coding-Challenges
This is coding challenges in P5.js libraries.

All codes in repository from Youtube tutorial series named coding train contributed byprofessor Danial Shiffman. I am so appreciate his passion and humorous style tutorials.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH)

Each coding challenges I would mark the number of the coding challenges with the original codes. Whats more I would extent the code to make effect different from the origin one and strength to understand the codes.
